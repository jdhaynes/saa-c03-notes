# AWS Fundamentals

## Public vs Private Services
There are three network zones, which refer to networking capablity rather than permissions.

* **Public internet zone**: allows users to access public AWS service via internet networking.
* **Public AWS zone**: attached to the public internet zone, and allows users on the internet to connect to AWS services (e.g. S3 buckets). Public refers to ability that users on the public internet can connect to a service, but doesn't imply that they can actually access it due to permissions.
* **Private AWS zone**: services that exist within a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**. They are not accessable in the public AWS zone unless configured.

## AWS Global Infrastructure
### AWS Regions
An **AWS region** is a geographic location which has a full deployment of AWS instructure - e.g. N. Virginia, Ohio, Sydney, London. Most AWS services are associated with a specific AWS region (e.g. E2), but some are global (e.g. IAM).

Benefits:
* Isolated fault domain - regions are completely isolated from eachother geographically, so problems in one region won't affect others.
* Geopolitical and governance seperation - each region is subject to different data governance. Data does not move between regions unless setup.
* Location control - tune for performance by moving infrastructure closer to customers.

### Availibility Zones (AZ)
Availability zones are seperated infrastructure within an AWS region - they are isolated from eachother in terms of storage, compute, networking and physical location. If one AZ experiences a power outage, the other AZs remain functional.

Can increase resilience of solution by distributing instances across multiple AZs within a region using virtual private clouds (VPCs) that span AZs.

### AWS Edge Locations
As AWS regions are not always near customers, **AWS edge locations** act as local distribution points at far more locations than AWS regions - this helps with reducing latency by reducing the distance between the client and the server. Example - Netflix serving video content as close to customers as possible with low latency.

### Levels of AWS Service Resilience
There are three different levels of resilience to describe an AWS service:
* Globally resilient - data is replicated globally across multiple regions, so isn't associated with a specific region. Can tolerate multiple failures. Examples are Route 53 and IAM.
* Region resilient - replicated across multiple AZs within a region. Continues operating if an AZ fails, but will fail if the whole region fails.
* AZ resilient - run only from single AZ, so the service will fail if the AZ fails. Prone to failure.

## Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)
* VPCs are private networks for private AWS services to run on. Also can be used to connect to on-premises networks (in hybrid environment) or to other cloud providers.
* Within 1 account and 1 AWS region.
* Private and isolated from other VPCs or public AWS zone (unless configured otherwise).
* Regionally resilient - distributed across multiple AZs in a region.
* **VPC CIDR** - the range of IP addresses that are allocated for services within the VPC to use.
* Other components are created along with the default VPC:
    * Internet gateway
    * Network ACL
    * Security group

Two types:
* Default VPC
    * Initially created by AWS and pre-configured in a specific, predictable away 
    * Less flexible than custom VPCs.
    * Can only have one per region.
    * Configured to have only one VPC CIDR range - is always 172.31.0.0/16
    * The /16 CIDR is split up into multiple /20 subnets, one for each AZ in the region. This makes the VPC regionally resilient. Note - there is a maximum of 16x /20 subnets within /16, so maximum of 16x AZs.
    * Can delete - you don't need it and not always suited for production due to flexibility.
* Custom VPC - 
    * Can have **many** per region. 
    * Completely configurable.

## AWS Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)
EC2 provides virtual machine instances as infrastructure-as-a-service (IAAS). 
* Use VPC networking and are private by default, but can be exposed to public. 
* AZ resilient - any given EC2 instance is associated with one AZ.
* Come in may sizes with different hardware allocations.
* Billed on demand (by second or hour). 
* Storage either provided by local on-host storage, or Elastic Block Store (EBS)
* A **key pair** must be created and downloaded locally to be able to connect to an EC2 instance via SSH with `ssh -i key.pem user@server`.

### Instance Lifecycle
EC2 instances have a **state** that indicates the status of the instance in the lifecycle (e.g. running, stopped or terminated). The state determines what the customer is billed for.

| State -> | Running | Stopped | Terminated |
| - | - | - | - |
| Compute | Billable |  |  |
| Memory | Billable |  |  |
| Storage | Billable | Billable |  |
| Networking | Billable |  |  |

### Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)
AMIs are snapshots of an operating system that can be used to launch new EC2 instances. AMIs can also be created from existing EC2 instances.

AMIs have the following permission options:
* Public 
* Owner only
* Specific AWS accounts

The following is stored in an AMI:
* Boot volume
* Block device mapping
* AMI permissions
* Data volumes

##Â AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)
S3 is a global object storage platform.
* Public service - runs in public zone.
* Regionally resilient - data is replicated across multiple AZs within a region.
* S3 data stored in a specific region and doesn't leave unless configured to replicate across regions.
* Unlimited data amounts and allows multi-user usage.
* Good for storing large amounts of data.
* Highly scalable in terms of data amount and number of users.

### Structure
* **Objects** are files that are stored in S3. They are stored in **buckets**, which are containers for objects.
* Objects are stored flat - i.e. all objects are stored at the root level unlike a traditional filesystem that has directories.
*  Filenames can have prefixes that are presented by S3 as folders, but are still actually stored flat. (e.g. /folder1/file.png).

### Objects
Has the following components:
* Key: the filename/ID.
* Value: the binary content of the object. Can be 0 bytes to 5TB.
* Other:
    * Version ID
    * Metadata
    * Access control
    * Sub resources

### Buckets
* Created in a specific AWS region and are region resilient.
* Data has primary home region and will not be replicated to other regions unless configured.
* Bucket name must be globally unique as S3 sits in the global namespace.
* Buckets will present object name prefixes as folders, despite being stored in flat structure. 
* Buckets are private by default - nobody has permissions to bucket except for creator account root user.
* Unblocking public access doesn't mean that the public can now access the bucket - it just means that now you are allowed to grant public access permissions. It acts as a failsafe check against accidentally granting public permissions.

## AWS CloudFormation
CloudFormation is an infrastructure as code (IAC) product used to provision and update AWS resources in a repeatable, consistent way. It uses **templates** to define the AWS resources required, and applying the template will cause AWS to automatically create, update and delete AWS resources to match the template. Templates can either be in YAML or JSON. Below shows the structure of a YAML template.

```yaml
# Optional - allows extension of standards over time. If omitted, this is assumed.
# If both AWSTemplateFormatVersion and Description are used, Description MUST ALWAYS immediately follow AWSTemplateFormatVersion.
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "version date"

# Optional - used to give information to users of the template.
Description:
  A sample template

# Optional - many functions, incl. how the UI presents the template data.
Metadata:
  template metadata

# Optional - defines fields that prompt the user for information. Examples - sizes of instances, how many AZs to use etc.
Parameters:
  set of parameters

# Optional - defines key-value pairs that can be used as lookup tables.
Mappings:
  set of mappings

# Optional - used to create conditions that are used to control provisioning.
Conditions:
  set of conditions

Transform:
  set of transforms

# The only mandatory section. Defines AWS resources to provision.
Resources:
  set of resources

# Optional - used tor return data to user after template has finished applying. E.g. returning IDs of resources, passwords.
Outputs:
  set of outputs
```

A template defines a set of **logical resources** which are the theoretical resources that should exist. A template is used to create a **stack**, which is a physical representation of the template containing working **physical resources**. When applying a template, CloudFormation ensures that logical resources and corresponding physical resources are kept in sync via create, update and delete operations.

Below shows an example of a logical resource defined in a template:
```yaml
Resources:
  Instance: # This defines a logical resource
    Type: 'AWS::EC2::Instance' # Defines what type of AWS service this resource should be
    Properties: # Configures the resource
      ImageId: !Ref LatestAmiId
      Instance Type: !Ref Instance Type
      KeyName: !Ref Keyname
```

## AWS CloudWatch
CloudWatch is an AWS product that enables collecting and monitoring of operational data. There are three types of data that CloudWatch can manage:
* Metrics - data concerning the performance of systems.
* Logs - data concerning logging data.
* Events - data concerning system events that can be used to trigger certain actions.

### Metrics
Metrics are timestamped data concerning the performance of AWS products, apps or on-prem systems. 
* Examples - CPU load and memory usage of EC2 instances. 
* Many metrics are setup by default on AWS products, but custom metrics can be collected by submitting them through an installed CloudWatch agent.
* A metric doesn't refer to a specific instance/resource, but a collection of data of the same metric from all relevant resources.

#### Namespaces
Namespaces is a an isolated container that is used to seperate metric data into different areas. For example, the `aws/ec2` AWS namespace contains metrics from EC2 instances. Custom namespaces can be created.

#### Dimensions
Dimensions are additional data added to a specific metric data point that allow datapoints to be viewed in a different perspective. Example - the instance ID for EC2 instances will allow metrics to be viewed for different instances.

#### Alarams
Alarms can be set to trigger certain actions (e.g. send notification through SNS) when a certain metric value is reached (e.g. CPU usage > 25%).

## Shared Responsibility Model
AWS are responsible for the security **'of'** the cloud:
* Regions, AZs, edge locations
* Hardware and global infrastructure
* Compute, storage, databases and networking

The customer is responsible for the security **'in'** the cloud:
* Data encryption, integrity and authentication
* Network traffic protection
* OS, network and firewall configuration
* Access management
* Customer data

## High Availability, Fault Tolerance and Disaster Recovery
### High Availability (HA)
* HA ensures that an agreed level of operational performance is maintained (e.g. server uptime) for a higher than normal period.
* HA does allow outages, but tries to minimise the negative impacts of them as much as possible - e.g. reducing downtime by as much as possible.
* HA can be achieved by spare infrastructure with switchover in case of failure. This may introduce a short disruption - e.g. users need to log back in.

### Fault Tolerance (FT)
* FT doesn't allow for outages and ensures that systems are able to continue operating through faults.
* Used for mission-critical systems thatg cannot tolerate any downtime.
* Much more complex and expensive to achieve than HA as it requires multiple levels of redundancy.

### Disaster Recovery (DR)
DR is a set of tools, policies and procedures to enable recovery and continuation of systems following a disaster (natural or human-induced) when HA and FT do not work. It can be achieved by:
* Pre-planning to ensure plans are in place to replace hardware and storing backups at another location.
* Maintaining copies of procedures and logins/credentials to streamline procedure when disaster happens.

## AWS Route 53 (R53)
* Managed DNS service that provides registration of domains and hosting DNS zones on nameservers.
* Global service and globally resilient.
* Zones (called **hosted zones** in AWS terminology) are hosted and replicated across 4 managed nameservers.
* Host zones can either be public or private (in VPCs)

### Types of Zone Records
* **A**: points a hostname (e.g. www) to an IPv4 address.
* **AAAA**: points a hostname (e.g. www) to an IPv6 address.
* **NS**: delegates to another nameserver.
* **MX**: points to a mail server.
    * Has a priorty value - lower values have higher priority.
    * If the record value has a dot at the end, it is a fully qualified domain name and may be external to the zone. If it doesn't have a dot, it is a host within the same zone.
* **TXT**: adds textual data to the domain. Usually used to prove domain ownership.

### Time to Live (TTL)
TTL specifies the time that a DNS zone should be cached at a resolver service so it can provide a quicker non-authoritative response. Once TTL expires, the resolver gets a fresh authoritiative answer and caches it again until TTL expires.

Low TTL = slower as more queries to the authoritative NS, but more flexibile incase changes are made.
High TTL = quicker as less queries to the authoritative NS, but can be problematic if zone changes are made as the "incorrect" non-authoritative answer is persisted for loner.
